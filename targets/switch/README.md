switch.p4
=========

The switch.p4 program describes a data plane of an L2/L3 switch.

Supported Features
------------------
1. Basic L2 switching: VLAN flooding and STP
2. Basic L3 Routing: IPv4 and IPv6 and VRF
3. LAG
4. ECMP
5. Tunneling: VXLAN and NVGRE (including L2/L3 Gateway), Geneve, and GRE
6. Basic ACL: MAC and IP ACLs
7. Unicast RPF check
8. MPLS: LER, LSR, IPVPN, VPLS, L2VPN

Upcoming Features
-----------------
1. Mirroring
2. Multicast: IP, PIM-SM
3. NAT
4. Counters/Statistics
5. Ingress Policers
6. QoS

Building Soft Switch
--------------------

The soft switch can be built with the auto-generated API or switchapi.

To build the softswitch with only the auto-generated API in a thrift server,

    make bm

To build the softswitch with the switchapi library,

    make bm-switchapi

When built with this option, there are thrift servers on ports 9090 and 9091
for the auto-generated table APIs and the switchapi library APIs respectively.

To build the softswitch with the SAI API library,

    make bm-switchsai

When built with this option, there are thrift servers on ports 9090, 9091 and
9092 for the auto-generated table APIs, the switchapi library APIs and the SAI
library APIs respectively.

To build the docker-image for a target, set the variable DOCKER_IMAGE in the
file 'Makefile' to the appropriate target name and run the following command.
By default, DOCKER_IMAGE is set to 'bm-switchsai'.

    make docker-image

Invoking make without an explicit target builds the softswitch with only the
auto-generated API (make bm).

For details on the features supported by switchapi, switchsai, and switchlink
libraries, please refer to the README.md file in the switchapi, switchsai, and
switchlink repositories respectively.

Running Tests
-------------

To run the pd thrift testcases,
