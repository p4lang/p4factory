Building Soft Switch
--------------------

The soft switch can be built with the auto-generated API or switchapi.

To build the softswitch with only the auto-generated API in a thrift server,

    make bm

To build the softswitch with the switchapi library

    make bm-switchapi

By default, the softswitch is built with only the auto-generated API.

When built with this option, there are two thrift servers (ports 9090 and 9091)
one for the auto-generated table APIs and the other for the switchapi library APIs

For details on the switchapi library features please refer to the README.md file in the switchapi repository.

Running Tests
-------------

To run the pd thrift testcases,

    sudo ./run_tests.py --test-dir of-tests/tests/pd-tests switch

To run the api thrift testcases,

    sudo ./run_tests.py --test-dir of-tests/tests/api-tests switch
